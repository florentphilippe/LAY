# LAY - Look After Yourself
To remember every single medecine you have to take in the day his always a tricky thing.   
LAY is going to remember every drug you have to take in the day for you ! 

This app is available only for Android.  

## Features :

The app is still in early development phase and must be used as a beta. Although the app is stable and ready-to-use, there is a lack of features.

### 1.  Current 
-   Add all your drugs with a simple click.
-   Don't have anything to worry about : just add a frequency for your drug and let the app manage it.
-   User-friendly simple insterface 

 ### 2. Projected
-   New Main Activity design (Maybe darktheme or something like).
-   Notification support & management.
-   Personal settings such as time of meals.

## Download & installation :
Unfortunatly the app is not present in the PlayStore yet and you have to install it 'manually' :p  

1. Go in your phone to **Settings > Security** and check **Unknown Source**.  
It will only allow you to install apps from other places than the PlayStore.

2. Then download the latest version of LAY [here](https://github.com/florentphilippe/LAY/raw/master/app/app-release.apk) ! When download is over just click on the file in the notifications panel.

3. Finally, click **install** and when the installation is finished choose **open**.
