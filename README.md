 ### 2. Projected
-   New Main Activity design (Maybe darktheme or something like).
-   Notification support & management.
-   Personal settings such as time of meals.

## Download & installation :
Unfortunatly the app is not present in the PlayStore yet and you have to install it 'manually' :p  

1. Go in your phone to **Settings > Security** and check **Unknown Source**.  
It will only allow you to install apps from other places than the PlayStore.

2. The download the latest version of LAY [here](https://github.com/florentphilippe/LAY/tree/master/app/app-release.apk) ! When download is over just hit the file in the notifications panel.

3. Finally, click **install** and when the installation is finished pick **open**.
